# Buffman-Jumpman

A 2D platformer created for the 2020 United Game Jam. Play as the dynamic duo of Jumpman and Buffman, two heroes each with their own skills and strengths, that must work together to solve the dungeon's puzzles and reach the goal. Inspired by Portal 2 and Ice Climbers, the game was developed to fit the theme "Two."

I led a team of three in developing the game. I was responsible for programming, gameplay design, locating assets, and infrastructure/project management. I worked with my brother who was responsible for level design and programming, and Andres Chamat, who did the music and a few of the sound effects.

Windows executable is available (download the archive file and unzip). Playable build is available at https://grahamewatt.com/buffman-jumpman
